# InfraKiwi

A wannabe collection of infrastructure tools!

## Notes from the author

The author of these projects is [Alberto Marchetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertomarchetti/).

The code is (and will be for some good time) disorderly and in continuous evolution.
I work on these projects in my free time, so it may take uncountable days before they are in any ready/usable state.
Also, commits may get squashed from time to time to clean up WIPs.

For the moment, if you want to support me, you can buy me an espresso on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/cmaster11)!

## The kiwi

All hail the 8-bit kiwi! ü•ù
