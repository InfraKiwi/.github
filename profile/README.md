# InfraKiwi

A wannabe collection of infrastructure tools!

## Notes from the author

The author of these projects is [Alberto Marchetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertomarchetti/).

The code is disorderly and continuously evolving.
I work on these projects in my free time, so it may take uncountable days before they are in any ready/usable state.
Also, commits may get squashed occasionally to clean up WIPs.

If you want to support me, you can buy me an espresso on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/cmaster11)!

## The kiwi

All hail the 8-bit kiwi! ü•ù
